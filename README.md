<h1>404 Page :ghost:</h1>

<h2>A 404 page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This 404 page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show the opening and closing of the navbar and scroll animation reveal. I created this following the tutorial of Bedimcode. I changed the background and text color of the page from the original. Screenshots of the website.</p>
